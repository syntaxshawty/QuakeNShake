# QuakeMap: Single Page App

- This simple web app uses the USGS API with the Mapbox API to visualize and interact with USGS earthquake data over the last hour, day, week, or month
- Each dot represents a quake; the darker the dot the higher in magnitude the quake
- Click on each dot to get more information about the quake including magnitude, time, and location
- Use the Mapbox Geocoder control to search, mark, and zoom into a specified location
- Navigate the map using Mapbox zoom controls
- The table on the right displays the data currently loaded on the map and can be sorted by time or magnitude

- This project uses Webpack and React + Redux
